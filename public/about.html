<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Sophia—a people-first creative with a background in travel, e-commerce, and account management. My career has taken me from helping travelers plan unforgettable journeys to supporting businesses with marketing, virtual assistance, and customer engagement. What ties all my experiences together is a deep love for connecting with others and creating thoughtful, human-centered work that makes an impact.</p>

<p>Currently, I work part-time as a Marketing Assistant, where I get to blend creativity and strategy through content planning, social media, and design tools like Canva. I’ve also worked as an Account Manager, Travel Consultant, and E-Commerce Live Chat Specialist, adapting quickly to each role and thriving in both team and independent environments. Whether I’m managing a client account, designing a post, or brainstorming reel ideas, I bring focus, warmth, and curiosity to everything I do.</p>

<p>Beyond work, I’m a lifelong learner with a growing interest in Spanish, a love for storytelling through videos, and a passion for exploring new places—often captured with my partner Sonny on our YouTube channel, Thor TV. I believe in simple joys, solid relationships, and doing work that feels both meaningful and fun. Let’s connect—I’m always up for new opportunities, creative projects, or a good conversation.</p>
